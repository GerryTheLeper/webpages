7. See if you can connect to a LAN server hosted on the network as this is the only sure-fire way to test the connection.
8. Finally, it's **highly recommended** that you change your IPv4 metric to 1. 
* Go to Control Panel → Network and Sharing Centre → Click on the Zerotier network

# Troubleshooting

## Check your network connections to make sure there isn’t more than one Zerotier



 1. Go to Control Panel -> Network and Internet -> Network and sharing centre -> Change adapter settings (on the left).
 2. You will see a window like below. Make sure there is only one Zerotier One network connected. If there are multiple, disable the other ones.
